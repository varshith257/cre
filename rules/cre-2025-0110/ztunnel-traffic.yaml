    title: "Ztunnel Traffic timeouts in Istio Ambient Mode"
    category: "istio-ambient-troubleshooting"
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      Detects when Istio Ambient-mode HBONE (mTLS) traffic is blocked or droppedâ€”
      resulting in Ztunnel logging timeouts such as `io error: deadline has elapsed`
      or `connection timed out, maybe a NetworkPolicy is blocking HBONE port 15008`.
    cause: |
      - NetworkPolicy or firewall rules blocking outbound port 15008
      - Misconfigured CNI or host-level iptables preventing HBONE tunnels
      - Node-level network segmentation or security groups dropping traffic
    impact: |
      - Pod-to-pod calls via ambient mode hang until timeout
      - Application requests fail silently or with long delays
      - Service reliability degraded due to hidden networking issues

      - ztunnel
    mitigation: |
      **IMMEDIATE:**
      - Inspect/allow egress on port 15008 in NetworkPolicies or firewalls
      - Verify host iptables aren't dropping HBONE traffic
      - From a ztunnel pod:  
        `kubectl exec -n istio-system <ztunnel-pod> -- nc -vz <pod-ip> 15008`

      **LONG-TERM:**
      - Enforce HBONE port rules in CI/CD
      - Monitor ztunnel logs for frequent timeouts & alert
