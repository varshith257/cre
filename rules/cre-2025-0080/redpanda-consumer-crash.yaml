      title: Redpanda Consumer Mass Disconnect → Coordinator Failure
      category: distributed-messaging-connectivity
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects high-severity failure when mass consumer disconnections overwhelm Redpanda's group coordinator.
        - Multiple consumers simultaneously leave consumer groups
        - Coordinator becomes unresponsive (NodeNotReadyError)
        - MemberIdRequiredError indicates coordinator state corruption
        - Can lead to complete message processing halt
        
      cause: |
        ROOT CAUSES:
        - Mass consumer disconnection (100+ consumers killed simultaneously)
        - Consumer group coordinator overwhelmed by concurrent LeaveGroup requests
        - Redpanda coordinator node resource exhaustion during rebalance storm
        - Network partition or container resource limits during high consumer churn
        
      impact: |
        BUSINESS IMPACT:
        - Complete halt of message processing for affected consumer groups
        - New consumers cannot join groups (MemberIdRequiredError)
        - Existing consumers stuck in rebalance loops
        - Data pipeline downtime until coordinator recovery
        - Potential message loss if consumers crash during processing

      mitigation: |
        IMMEDIATE:
        - Restart affected consumer applications in small batches
        - Monitor Redpanda coordinator health: `rpk cluster info`
        - Check for coordinator election: `rpk group describe <group-name>`
        - Reduce consumer concurrency during recovery
        
        RECOVERY ACTIONS:
        - Restart Redpanda if coordinator remains unresponsive
        - Clear consumer group state: `rpk group delete <group-name>`
        - Implement graceful consumer shutdown with staggered delays
        - Monitor system resources during consumer scaling
        
        PREVENTION STRATEGIES:
        - Implement circuit breaker pattern for consumer creation
        - Add jitter to consumer startup/shutdown timing
        - Monitor consumer group rebalance frequency
        - Set appropriate session.timeout.ms and heartbeat.interval.ms
        - Use consumer group instance IDs for better tracking
