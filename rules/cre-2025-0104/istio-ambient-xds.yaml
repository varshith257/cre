      title: "Istio Ambient traffic fails with timed out waiting for workload from xds"
      category: "istio-ambient-troubleshooting"
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Ztunnel must fetch pod workload info from Istiod over XDS before tunneling.
        If it doesn't receive a response within ~5s, it rejects the connection with:
        `timed out waiting for workload … from xds`. Intermittent XDS delays may
        indicate Istiod overload or misconfiguration (e.g. PILOT_DEBOUNCE_AFTER).
      cause: |
        - Istiod is under heavy CPU/memory pressure and slow to respond.
        - Network policies or CNI are blocking port 15012 (XDS) between ztunnel and Istiod.
        - PILOT_DEBOUNCE_AFTER or other Envoy debouncing has been increased.
      impact: |
        - Connections through ztunnel intermittently fail with timeout errors.
        - Applications may observe dropped requests or circuit‐breaker trips.
      mitigation: |
        IMMEDIATE:
        - Check Istiod pod resource usage: `kubectl -n istio-system top pods istiod-xxx`
        - Inspect ztunnel logs for repeated XDS timeouts.
        - Ensure port 15012 TCP is open between all nodes and istiod.
        RECOVERY:
        - Scale up Istiod deployment or increase resources.
        - Review meshConfig.PILOT_DEBOUNCE_* and revert experimental changes.
