      description: |
        In Ambient mode, Istio applies a SNAT rule so that kubelet probe traffic
        appears from 169.254.7.127 and is bypassed by the data-plane.  If you see
        **Readiness probe failed** events begin only after enabling Ambient, it
        almost always means that SNAT/bypass isn't working in your CNI or
        networking environment.
      cause: |
        - The host SNAT rule for kubelet (169.254.7.127) is missing or being overwritten.
        - A CNI (e.g. Cilium with bpf.masquerade=true, Calico <3.29 with bpfEnabled)
          is rewriting probe traffic unexpectedly.
        - A network policy or security group is blocking traffic from kubelet.
      impact: |
        - Pods never become Ready (stuck in CrashLoopBackOff or Pending).
        - Services relying on readiness will not receive traffic, causing outages.
      mitigation: |
        IMMEDIATE:
        - Inspect host iptables: `iptables -t nat -L ISTIO_REDIRECT` shows the SNAT rule.
        - On each node, confirm kubelet source SNAT: `iptables -t nat -L OUTPUT`.
        - Check your CNI docs for ambient prerequisites (Cilium/Calico, AWS SGs).
        RECOVERY:
        - Adjust your CNI so it does not masquerade kubelet source IP.
        - Remove conflicting NetworkPolicy blocking port 15021/8080 on probes.
