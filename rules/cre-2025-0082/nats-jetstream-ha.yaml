      title: "NATS JetStream HA failures: monitor goroutine, consumer stalls and unsynced replicas"
      category: "message-queue-problem"
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects high-availability failures in NATS JetStream clusters due to:
        
        1. **Monitor goroutine failure** — after node restarts, Raft group fails to elect a leader  
        2. **Consumer deadlock** — using DeliverPolicy=LastPerSubject + AckPolicy=Explicit with low MaxAckPending  
        3. **Unsynced replicas** — object store replication appears healthy but data is lost or inconsistent between nodes

        These issues lead to invisible data loss, stalled consumers, or stream unavailability.
      impact: |
        - **Scenario 1**: Stream becomes unusable (publishes/read fail) due to no Raft leader  
        - **Scenario 2**: Consumer stalls with `context deadline exceeded`, ACKs no longer move floor  
        - **Scenario 3**: Object Store data loss occurs silently across restarts despite healthy status  
        All scenarios disrupt reliability of JetStream-based systems and violate consistency expectations.
      cause: |
        - [Monitor failure]: JetStream monitor goroutine did not start after server restart  
        - [Consumer stall]: ACK/sequence tracking inconsistency under `LastPerSubject + Explicit ACK + low MaxAckPending`  
        - [Replica drift]: Raft replicas fall out of sync silently (especially during cold restart or recovery), leading to inconsistent object store contents
      mitigation: |
        - Always enable JetStream before ReadyForConnections  
        - Use ProcessConfigString instead of on-the-fly JS enablement  
        - Avoid MaxAckPending < 100 with DeliverPolicy=LastPerSubject  
        - Run regular `nats stream-check --unsynced` checks  
        - To recover object store:  
          - Scale stream to replicas=1 and back  
          - Or remove faulty replica via `nats stream cluster ... peer-remove`  
        - Monitor for raftz and jsz inconsistencies in tooling
